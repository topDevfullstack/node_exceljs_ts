# Express ExcelJS test application based on typescript to generate some ExcelJS files

## Purpose

This project was generated to test the ExcelJS library and to generate some ExcelJS files. The project is not intended to be used in production.
I used this to look for some bug when populating cells with a formula containing a result of 0.

## Development server

Before running the first time run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
Run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start-dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
